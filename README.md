# logistic lasso algorithm

This repo contains the logistic lasso algorithm. The functions are coded based on the coordinate descent with penalized iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. 

- functions.R: functions for fitting the logistic lasso and predicting

- make_tidy.R: functions for building up the workflow of logistic lasso

- vignette.pdf: the instruction of using the logistic lasso algorithm
